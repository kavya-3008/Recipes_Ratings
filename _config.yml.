title: [Recipes and Ratings Analysis]
description: [ Food is a necessity in everyone's lives, and there are a lot of recipes freely available for people to follow, but it isn't obvious which ones are actually good. This dataset allows us to analyze the factors i.e. prep time, number of ingredients, nutrition, that affect the rating of a recipe. This is particularly useful to students as being at university is the first time most students start to cook independently. This dataset can reveal insights that will help students make informed decisions about what recipes they should follow and what meals to cook etc.]
